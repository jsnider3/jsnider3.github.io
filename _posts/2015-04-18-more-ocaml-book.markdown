My first attempt to learn OCaml was back in January, it largely took the
form of "write code and then ask Google why it doesn't work." You can
see the results of that process at 
<https://github.com/jsnider3/newbie_OCaml>.  

This wasn't the fastest process and instilled in me a deep rage at
OCaml for repeatedly failing to be Haskell. I decided to be more 
disciplined with my second attempt to learn OCaml and ordered a dead-tree
copy of "More OCaml: Algorithms, Methods, and Diversions" by John 
Whitington.  

The book starts off assuming the reader knows how to program,
just like it's advertised, and shoves all the details of writing a 
working OCaml into the preface. The first chapter is all about
learning to appreciate the power of `fold` in functional programming and
the second chapter is showing how to implement lazy lists in OCaml, just 
in case those snooty Haskellers think their language is more powerful.

Moving on through the book, experienced programmers learn how to do 
run-length encoding compression, a limited form of regexes, and
 playing tic-tac-toe in OCaml and eventually create pdfs programmatically.  

The book uses an excessive amount of while and for loops, but it's
definitely a good book for experienced programmers wishing to learn
OCaml to work through.
