I'm a computer scientist, both as a professional and a
hobbyist. I have a master's and bachelor's in computer science.
Both of them are from George Mason.

My current interests as a computer scientist are full-stack development,
the cloud, comparative programming languages, and compilers/interpreters.

I can be reached either through the email at the bottom
of the page, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-snider/5a/482/6ba) page, or leaving a comment.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy biking, karaoke, and
working out.
Further information is not available here.
