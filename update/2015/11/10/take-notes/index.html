    <h1>You're not Taking Enough Notes</h1>
    <p class="meta">Nov 10, 2015</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>One of the skills I developed since starting this blog was note taking.
I got through college largely on the slides and my natural talent for
programming, but this was me unwittingly taking the hard route. Nowadays,
I take notes for everything. Every bug I work on at work has a folder
containing all the notes I took while working on it, every talk I listen
to at a meetup results in a few hundred words of notes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and my class
notes are 20-30 page long LaTeX pdfs. It’s good because it forces you to
pay attention, organize your thoughts for others, and lets you review them
when you start to forget.</p>

<p>Sitting in a room and listening to someone talk can be done mindlessly,
so can flipping through a pdf or a PowerPoint, but you can’t say the same
thing for taking some words, paraphrasing them, and typing as much of the
most relevant parts as you can in real-time. For those more prone to
fidgeting, you can keep your hands busy being useful. For those prone to
daydreaming, you can keep your brain stimulated thinking about what you
should be thinking about.</p>

<p>Note taking disciplines your thoughts by taking them outside the jumbled
mess within your brain and putting them in the structure of a common
language. If you get in the habit of formatting your notes neatly, they
can be used as a rough draft for say a presentation or a blog post or
anything where you need to present your thoughts to others<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It can
also get you in the habit of writing a rough draft quickly and coming back
later for editing, which I feel strengthens your general writing ability<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
These behaviors start a positive feedback loop, where you think
about what questions other people would have on a topic and make sure your
notes address them. For some of my bug fix notes, I’ve distributed them to
engineers working on similar or even the same problem. This saved them the
hassle of either rediscovering my work or hoping I still remember the
particulars when they ask me in person.</p>

<p>The human brain is of course not as good at remembering as the cloud<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
Instead of having an endless torrent of ideas cycle through my
brain and out into oblivion, I can keep a record. I’m sure we’ve all faced
the situation where we know we used to know something, but can’t remember
it. As my set notes grow in volume, I know I will have a deep source of
reference material for anything my future self will want to know<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of knowledge just a Google search away, but I have a source
which is inherently relevant to what I want to know and which has made me
a better writer and listener by making it. I hope you all will take this
as inspiration to store information you want to remember in a durable,
universal format: text.</p>
